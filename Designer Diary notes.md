Designer Diary
==============

This is where I will note the various discoveries, challenges, and otherwise noteworthy events encountered during developement.

##week one

GitHub
* local copy vs on server
* public repo free, private $$
* GitHub for Windows very clean, metro ui

Hello World
* Main hub for windows 8 app info is msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps
* documentation is great at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/
* package.appxmanifest contains lots of important properties
* WinJS controls + promises
* Using JQuery in Win 8 apps: http://www.incloud.de/2012/08/windows-8-using-jquery-for-app-development/

##week two

Feeling things out
* switched projects - too many issues to deal with TeamPulse oAuth, getting in the way of desired learning
* spent hours reviewing sample apps and reading documentation on metro app design (patterns, controls, etc)
* discovered html5 indexedDb, stores JSON documents locally to browser, will be storage mechanism of choice
* discovered roaming application data (used to sync app settings across devices).
  * Blog: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsappdev/archive/2012/07/17/roaming-your-app-data.aspx
  * Guidelines: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465094.aspx
* decided to try a Hub interface, designed initial hub mock
* discovered Metro Studio for some decent stock icons: http://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/metrostudio
* created new project in VS using Navigation WinJS template
  * modified sample data in data.js to resemble mock
  * renamed hub page
  * modified package.appmanifest appropriately
